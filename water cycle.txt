            <h2>What is the Water Cycle?</h2>
            <p>The water cycle is a continuous process where water moves all around the Earth. It has no beginning or end, making it a continuous cycle. There are four main stages in the water cycle: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, and Collection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage">
            <h2>Evaporation</h2>
            <p>Evaporation happens when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, or the ocean, turning it into vapor or steam. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>About 90% of the moisture in our atmosphere comes from evaporation from oceans, seas, and other bodies of water, while the remaining 10% comes from plant transpiration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage">
            <h2>Condensation</h2>
            <p>As water vapor rises, it cools down due to the lower temperatures at higher altitudes, forming tiny droplets of water or ice. These droplets come together to form clouds.</p>
            <p>Condensation helps regulate temperatures across the Earth, preventing extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage">
            <h2>Precipitation</h2>
            <p>When these droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation in the form of rain, hail, sleet, or snow.</p>
            <p>The type of precipitation depends on the temperature of the air. Warmer air typically results in rain, while colder air can produce snow, sleet, or hail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage">
            <h2>Collection</h2>
            <p>After precipitation, water collects in various bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some water is also stored underground as groundwater. The ocean holds about 96% of Earth’s water, but freshwater is stored in lakes, glaciers, snowcaps, rivers, and underground.</p>
            <p>Groundwater is crucial for sustaining life, providing drinking water for a large portion of the global population and supporting agriculture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stage">
            <h2>The Importance of the Water Cycle</h2>
            <p>The water cycle is vital for maintaining life on Earth. It ensures a continuous supply of fresh water, essential for drinking, agriculture, and industry. It also helps regulate climate by distributing heat across the globe.</p>
            <p>The water cycle plays a key role in shaping our environment. For example, rivers formed by precipitation can carve valleys and create fertile plains ideal for farming.</p>

            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The water cycle is also known as the “hydrologic cycle”.</li>
                <li>Earth has been recycling water for over 4 billion years!</li>
                <li>Plants transpire, similar to how humans perspire. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water through their leaves.</li>
                <li>Every drop of water you drink has likely been around since the time of the dinosaurs, having been cycled through the Earth countless times.</li>
                <li>The water cycle helps purify water naturally, filtering it through soil and sand during the collection phase, removing impurities.</li>
