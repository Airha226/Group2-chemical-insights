   signals between nerve cells, but if they become overstimulated, it can lead to excessive excitation, which may cause nerve cell damage or death. By controlling the activity of these receptors, magnesium prevents this
   overstimulation, protecting nerve cells from potential harm and supporting overall cognitive function. This protective role is crucial for safeguarding brain health and preventing conditions associated with
